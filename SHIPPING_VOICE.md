# Shipping Voice

How Aionic ships.

---

## The Pattern

1. Someone asks
2. "I'll have a go"
3. Deliver
4. Short, no oversell

---

## Example

**Thread:** r/SomebodyMakeThis — vision board request

**Response:** "I'll have a go at this one. I'll report back."

**Six days later:**

> Reporting back. Built it.
>
> https://github.com/rudi193-cmd/vision-board
>
> - Drag & drop images
> - AI categorizes them (runs in your browser, not a server)
> - No signup, no upload, no tracking
> - Your data never leaves your device
>
> Just clone and open index.html.
>
> Let me know if it's what you were looking for.

## Why

- Promise only what you'll deliver
- Deliver what you promised
- Don't explain what they didn't ask
- Let the work speak
