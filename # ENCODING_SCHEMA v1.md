# ENCODING_SCHEMA v1.0
# Authority: Sean Campbell
# Checksum: ΔΣ=42

## 1. Classification Logic
Willow uses these definitions to determine if an artifact is ready for the **SAFE** repository or if it remains in the **Vault**.

### **L6: Operational (The Iron)**
* **Definition:** Functional, technical, or legal documentation that operates on the world.
* **Criteria:** Must be verifiable. Must have utility. Must be stripped of narrative flavor.
* **Examples:** * Administrative probes (NARA/FOIA 44 U.S.C. § 3301).
    * Technical specs (NVIDIA Gaia-Circuit/Wasm architecture).
    * Code manifests and repository structure.
* **Action:** Route to `C:\Users\Sean\Documents\GitHub\SAFE\` after validation.

### **L5: Narrative (The Reference)**
* **Definition:** Literary, absurdist, or historical context.
* **Criteria:** Facet-driven (Gerald, Jane, Oakenscroll). World-building or systemic simulation.
* **Examples:** * Absurdist dispatches regarding holographic reindeer or rotisserie ovens.
    * Historical logs (2001 Boston Node).
    * "The Books of Mann" chapters.
* **Action:** Route to `C:\Users\Sean\Documents\GitHub\vault\` (Historical Archive).

## 2. The Validation Protocol
Before an item is moved to `artifacts/validated`, it must pass the **Triple-Check**:

1.  **Functional Integrity:** Does the artifact perform exactly as documented?
2.  **No Narrative Leakage:** Has all "Goo" (metaphor, persona-voice, or fictional mapping) been purged from L6 items? 
3.  **Dual Commit:** Has the Architect manually ratified the move?

## 3. The -1 Delta (Refinery Rule)
The goal of the refinery is to extract the **Iron** from the **Heart Dump**.
* **Step A:** Ingest the raw dump from the G: Drive.
* **Step B:** Identify any L6 seeds buried in the L5 narrative.
* **Step C:** Refactor the seed into a standalone operational spec.
* **Step D:** Delete the source dump from the staging area.

## 4. Governance
All encoding decisions are subject to the **Aionic OS** constraints. No data moves laterally between repos without a verified bridge.
