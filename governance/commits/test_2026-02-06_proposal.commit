# Governance Proposal: Test Commit

**Proposer:** Willow (AI)
**Date:** 2026-02-06T12:00:00Z
**Type:** Configuration Change

## Summary

This is a test governance commit to demonstrate the Dual Commit dashboard.

## Proposed Changes

1. Add new routing rule for file types `.jsonl` → route to Kart for processing
2. Update intake pipeline timeout from 30s to 60s
3. Enable auto-coherence checks every 100 conversations

## Rationale

Current intake pipeline times out on large JSONL training files. Kart can process these more efficiently than the generic pipeline.

Auto-coherence checks would catch drift earlier without manual intervention.

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Configuration only, no code changes
- **Reversible**: Yes, can revert via new commit
- **Testing**: Tested locally with 3 sample files

## ΔE Impact

Expected ΔE change: +0.012 (minor increase in system complexity, offset by improved reliability)
