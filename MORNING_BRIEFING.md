# Morning Briefing
**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** Plans complete, ready to execute

---

## 📋 What We Built Last Night (Before Sleep)

### ✅ Auto-Logging System
**Status:** LIVE and working
- Every fleet call logs to `patterns_provider.db`
- Tracks: provider, task type, response time, success
- Learning which providers are best at what

**Current Data:**
- Groq: html_generation (1464ms)
- Cerebras: javascript_generation (961ms) ⚡ faster
- System learning: Cerebras > Groq for JS

### ✅ Control Desktop v1
**Status:** LIVE at `http://localhost:8420/system`
- 7 cards: Providers, Queues, Nodes, Learning, Rules, Patterns, Governance
- Working modals for: Nodes, Governance
- Clean 4-column layout, terminal theme
- Action buttons ready (nodes can show "Create DB")

### ✅ Provider Health Mesh
**Status:** Integrated into llm_router
- Auto-blacklists after 5 failures
- Auto-heals after 10 minutes
- Filters blacklisted providers from rotation
- All logged to `provider_health.db`

## 📚 Build Plans Created

### 1. OVERNIGHT_STACK.md (PRIORITY ORDER)
**30 hours of work across 4 nights**

**Stack 1:** Fleet Feedback System (3hr) - HIGH PRIORITY
- Annotate bad outputs from fleet
- Teach prompts to avoid past mistakes
- Closes the learning loop

**Stack 2:** Control Desktop Complete (11hr)
- File annotation system (users mark files correct/wrong with notes)
- Node DB creation (fix all 9 no_db nodes)
- 5 remaining modals (providers, queues, learning, rules, patterns)
- Smart routing (use performance data)
- File inspection (preview files before annotating)

**Stack 3:** Main Willow UI (5hr)
- Make chat input more obvious
- Add loading indicators
- Add command palette (/help, /status, etc.)
- Persistent chat history
- Better error messages

**Stack 4:** /pocket Redesign (3hr)
- Match terminal aesthetic
- Mobile-friendly
- Show connection status
- Offline mode

**Stack 5:** Integration Testing (4hr)
- End-to-end workflows
- Cross-device testing
- Bug fixes

### 2. CONTROL_DESKTOP_BUILD_PLAN.md (DETAILED SPECS)
**Full technical specifications**
- Database schemas with SQL
- API endpoints with code examples
- UI mockups with HTML
- JavaScript implementations
- Test scenarios
- Success criteria

## 🎯 What You Asked For

> "For #2, it needs to be more than yes or no, it needs to be why as well. A note box for the file, so I can say what it is, or what I think it is."

**✅ Planned in Stack 2, Phase 1.3:**
- File annotation modal with text box
- Mark correct/wrong + explain why
- Stores in `file_annotations` table
- Becomes training data for learning

> "Did you tell groq why they were mistaken?"

**✅ Addressed in Stack 1:**
- Fleet feedback system captures bad outputs
- Annotate what was wrong and why
- Enhances future prompts with corrections
- Same principle as file annotations

> "We also had main willow UI work that needed to be done, and /pocket work."

**✅ Planned in Stack 3 & 4:**
- Stack 3: 5 UI improvements for main Willow
- Stack 4: /pocket restyled to match desktop

## 🚀 What to Do First

### Option A: Start Building (Recommended)
1. Read `OVERNIGHT_STACK.md` for priority order
2. Start with **Stack 1: Fleet Feedback** (closes learning loop)
3. Use free fleet for generation (will auto-log)
4. Test feedback system by rating outputs
5. Move to Stack 2 (annotations + modals)

### Option B: Review & Adjust
1. Read both plan files
2. Adjust priorities if needed
3. Add/remove tasks
4. Then start building

## 📊 Current System State

### What's Working
✅ Provider health mesh (auto-blacklist/heal)
✅ Auto-logging (patterns_provider.db)
✅ Control desktop (7 cards, 2 modals)
✅ Round-robin routing
✅ Governance tracking

### What's Pending
⏳ File annotation system
⏳ 9 nodes need databases created
⏳ 5 modals incomplete (providers, queues, learning, rules, patterns)
⏳ Fleet feedback system
⏳ Smart routing based on performance
⏳ Main Willow UI improvements
⏳ /pocket redesign

### Critical Issues to Fix
🔴 9 nodes showing "no_db" (Stack 2, Phase 2)
🟡 Users can't verify learned patterns (Stack 2, Phase 1)
🟡 No feedback loop for fleet outputs (Stack 1)
🟡 Main UI not intuitive (Stack 3)

---

## 💾 Databases Created

1. `artifacts/willow/provider_health.db` ✅
   - provider_health table
   - health_events table

2. `artifacts/willow/patterns.db` ✅
   - provider_performance table

3. `artifacts/willow/willow_knowledge.db` ✅ (per user)
   - knowledge table
   - entities table
   - conversations table

4. `artifacts/willow/fleet_feedback.db` ⏳ (to be created)
   - fleet_feedback table

5. `artifacts/willow/file_annotations.db` ⏳ (to be created)
   - file_annotations table

---

## 🧪 Quick Tests

### Test Auto-Logging
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Sean\Documents\GitHub\Willow"
python -c "import sqlite3; conn = sqlite3.connect('artifacts/willow/patterns.db'); print(conn.execute('SELECT * FROM provider_performance ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 3').fetchall())"
```

### Test Provider Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8420/api/health/providers | python -m json.tool
```

### Test Control Desktop
```bash
# Open browser: http://localhost:8420/system
# Click: Nodes card
# Should see modal with 9 nodes and "Create Database" buttons
```

## 🎨 Design Notes

**Terminal Aesthetic:**
- Background: `#0a0a0a`
- Text: `#00ff00` (bright green)
- Accent: `#00cc00` (medium green)
- Font: `Courier New, monospace`
- Borders: `1px solid #00ff00`
- Hover: `box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)`

**All UIs should match this theme:**
- Control desktop ✅
- Main Willow ⏳
- /pocket ⏳
- Governance dashboard ✅

## 🤔 Key Insights from Last Session

1. **"Teach the free fleet to use the free fleet"**
   - You need better prompts
   - You need feedback on outputs
   - You need to remember which providers do what well
   → Stack 1 addresses this

2. **"Desktop not dashboard"**
   - Not just monitoring, but control
   - Every problem has a fix button
   - Verify learning, don't just trust it
   → Stack 2 addresses this

3. **"More than yes/no, explain why"**
   - Annotations need context
   - Build knowledge graph of edge cases
   - Training data for future learning
   → File annotation system addresses this

4. **"Use what's available"**
   - Free fleet should do grunt work
   - You orchestrate and verify
   - System learns from corrections
   → Auto-logging + feedback addresses this

---

## 🎯 The Vision

You're building **auditable AI orchestration**:
1. Fleet does work (generation, refactoring, summarization)
2. You verify outputs (mark correct/wrong with notes)
3. System learns from corrections (better prompts, smarter routing)
4. Eventually: trusted autonomous operation with audit trails

**Not blind automation, but supervised learning with human ratification.**

## ⏰ Time Estimates

- **Stack 1 (Fleet Feedback):** 3 hours
- **Stack 2.1-2.2 (Annotations Core):** 5 hours
- **Stack 2.3 (Node DB):** 2 hours
- **Stack 2.4 (Modals):** 4 hours
- **Stack 3 (Main UI):** 5 hours
- **Stack 4 (/pocket):** 3 hours
- **Stack 5 (Testing):** 4 hours

**Total:** ~26 hours

**Realistic Schedule:**
- 4 nights × 6 hours = 24 hours core work
- +2 hours buffer for bugs/testing
- = 26 hours

## 🌙 Good Morning!

The plans are ready. The foundation is built. Auto-logging is working. Provider health is tracking. The control desktop is live.

**Next step:** Start with Stack 1 (fleet feedback) to close the learning loop.

Everything you asked for is in the stack. Let's build the system that builds itself better.

**Files to Review:**
1. `OVERNIGHT_STACK.md` ← Start here (priority order)
2. `CONTROL_DESKTOP_BUILD_PLAN.md` ← Reference this (detailed specs)
3. `MORNING_BRIEFING.md` ← You're reading it

**First Task:**
Open `OVERNIGHT_STACK.md` → Begin Stack 1 → Use free fleet → Provide feedback on outputs → Test the feedback system

Ready when you are. ☕
